# Lab 3 - Burrito Class

In this next lab, you will need to create a class called Burrito, this class will determine the price of a burrito with certain ingredients. Use the comments and the function prototypes to complete their definitions in Burrito.cpp. Most of the functions are self-explanatory, getters like meat or cheese will return the value of the member variable they try to get; setters will set a new value into the member variable referenced. <br><br>
The function price is the most difficult; a burrito’s starting price is $2 dollars, that is a burrito with no meat and no cheese; adding cheese to the burrito will increase its price by $1, adding meat (any kind) will add $2, but if the meat is Asada then that is more expensive (that is a good cut) it’ll add $1 to the cost. If your calculations are correct you should get the output as shown below.

<strong>When you are done be sure to update this repo to contain the most recent version of your program and submit a comment in BB telling me you are done</strong>

The following is the basic criteria to be used to grade your submission:
You start with 100 points and then lose points as you don't do something that is required.

* -20: Incorrect/Missing member variables.
* -20: Incorrect/Missing member function definitions.
* -15: Function definitions should access the class Burrito.
* -10: Missing name/not enough comments.
* -40 Does not compile.


<strong>Important: more points may be lost for other reasons not specified here.</strong>
